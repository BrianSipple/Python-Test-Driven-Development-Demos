		# When she hits enter, the page updates, and now the page lists
		# "1: Buy orange spools" as an item in a to-do list

		# There is still a text box inviting her to add another item. She
		# enters "Buy orange spools to make a coffee mug (Helga is also a coffee connoisseur)
		#
		#
		# The page updates again, and now shows both items on her list

		# Helga wonders whether the site will remember her list. Then she sees
		# that the site has generated a unique URL for her -- there is some
		# explanatory text to that effect.

		# She visits that URL - her to-do list is still there.

		# Satisfied, she goes back to sleep
